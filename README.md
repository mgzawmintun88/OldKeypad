# Old Keypad Simulator
### Description
The Old Keypad Simulator is a console application that emulates the behavior of old mobile phone keypads, where each numeric key corresponds to specific letters. Users can input strings of numbers and special characters (*, #), and the application processes the input to display the corresponding text output.

# Features

Maps numbers (2-9) to letters (e.g., 2 -> a/b/c).
Supports special characters:
`*` to delete the last character.
-`#` to confirm input and display the final result.
Handles invalid inputs gracefully: Notifies the user if invalid characters are entered.
Interactive Console UI: Allows users to type input strings dynamically and see results in real time.
